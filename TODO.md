# TODO: Make project start and remove unnecessary ML models

- [x] Update package.json scripts to include starting the ML-backend
- [x] Remove unnecessary ML-related files and directories (train_vgg16.py, yolov5/, model/, dataset/, progress-tracker/, ml-backend/ml-backend/)
- [x] Install dependencies for ML-backend if needed
- [x] Test the full project startup (ML-backend on 5000, server on 5001, client installing)
